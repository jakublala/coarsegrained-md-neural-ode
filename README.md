## Theoretical Background <a name="theory"></a>

## Project's Vision <a name="vision"></a>

## Code Structure <a name="code"></a>

## How to Use <a name="howto"></a>
To run the code, one has to first get comfortable with the `Trainer` class that forms the basis of all training, including testing and validating.



## Collaboration <a name="collab"></a>
If you are eager to help out with this project, I am more than happy to get you on board. There is a lot of small fixes and optimization things that could be improved. 

Ideally you should create your own fork and then for each feature added make a new branch. Once you are happy for review, you can submit a pull request and we can discuss the changes/improvements. Either way, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:jakublala@gmail.com">jakublala@gmail.com</a> so that we can be in touch and figure out the details.
